# Hagiwo Unison VCO -- module for ASMR
This module is based on [a design](https://note.com/solder_state/n/na0ae5754fa9c) by Japanese engineer "[Hagiwo](https://note.com/solder_state)".  This ASMR module is derived from the EuroRack version of their module.

## About
The Unison is based on the Arduino compatible [Seeed XIAO RA4M1](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeed-XIAO-RA4M1-p-5943.html) processor module featuring two oscillators and wavetable. Amazingly, it is touted as having a total BOM cost of about $9 in prototype form. Another benefit of the RA4M1 based Unison module is that experimenters can study and modify the open source code that generates the functionality of the module.

## What is ASMR?
[ASMR -- Advanced Synth Module Rack System](https://github.com/CircuitMonkey/advanced-synth-module-rack).  A modern alternative to Eurorack.
