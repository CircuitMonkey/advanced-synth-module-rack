# Hagiwo Mod2 -- module for ASMR
This module is based on the highly versatile [Mod2 design](https://note.com/solder_state/n/nce8f7defcf98) by Japanese engineer "[Hagiwo](https://note.com/solder_state)".  The Mod2 can operate as a VCO, but can be programmed to masquerade as many types of dedicated drum instruments. This ASMR module is derived from the EuroRack version of their module.

## About
The Unison is based on the Arduino compatible RaspberryPi RP2350 chip. Here, we use the [Raspberry Pi Pico 2 - RP2350](https://www.adafruit.com/product/6006) processor module. Amazingly, it is touted as having a total BOM cost of about $9 in prototype form. Another benefit of the RP2350 based Mod2 module is that experimenters can study and modify the open source code that generates the functionality of the module.

## What is ASMR?
[ASMR -- Advanced Synth Module Rack System](https://github.com/CircuitMonkey/advanced-synth-module-rack).  A modern alternative to Eurorack.
